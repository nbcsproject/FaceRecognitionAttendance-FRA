# LBP&DCP(C++)

## algorithm.cpp

> Encapsulating the LBP algorithm and the DCP algorithm, the texture features of the specified image can be obtained by calling any one of  `Mat LBP(Mat src)`, `Mat DCP1(Mat src, int Rin, int Rex)` or `Mat DCP2(Mat src, int Rin, int Rex)`.

> Calculating a one-dimensional histogram of a feature image.

## traintest.cpp

Train the training set according to the specified CSV file and test its recognition rate **(Note: When using the DCP algorithm, you need to modify the program to concatenate the histogram)**.

## main.cpp

Program entry **(Note: When using the DCP algorithm, it is recommended to set Rin to 1 and Rex to 4)**.

**(Note: The default grid_x and grid_y are taken as 1. If you want better recognition accurcy, set the value of grid_x and grid_y to 8. But note that this will bring more calculation work and program running time.)**
